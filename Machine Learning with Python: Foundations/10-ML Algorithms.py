    # Linear Regression: 
    #                   models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent 
    #                   variables using a straight line.Used more predictions
    # 
    # Logistic Regression: 
    #                   models te relationship between the independent variables and the dependent
    #                   variable using a sigmoid curve. Often used for binary classification problems
    # 
    # Decision Tree: 
    #               represents the relationship between the values of one or more independent variables
    #               and those of a dependent varible using an inverted tree-like structure.
    #               Solves both classification and regression problems.

    # Neural networks: 
    #               text tranlation, image recognation, and used for deep learning
    #               - Random Forests: 
    #               - Gradient Boosing Machines
    # k_Means Clustering: 
    #               groups items into one of 'k' clusters based on similarity.
    #              often used for customer segmentation, document labeling and anomaly detection
    # Association Rules: 
    #               are a set of if then statements that describe the co-occurrence of items within data#.
