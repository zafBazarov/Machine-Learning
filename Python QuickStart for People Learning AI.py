# Python Basics

# Data Types
    # A way to classify data to process it appropriately and efficiently
# Text 
      # Strings = chracter sequences e.g. "Hello", "He11o!"
         a = 'This is a tring' # no difference between ' and " quotation nut
         b = 'Zafar said "Python is awesome!"' # here " may cause an error 

# Numbers
        # Ints = integers e.g. 1,2, 42
          integer = 1
        # Floats = numbers with decimals e.g. 1.0, 1.34
          float = 3.41

# Lists = ordered collection of values
          lst1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']  # a list of strings

          lst2 = [1, 2, 3]        # a list of ints

          lst3 = ["a", 1, 3.14]   # list with string, int and float

          lst4= [["a","b"], [1, 2], [2.2, 3.3]] # list of lists

# Dictionaries = key-value pair sequences
